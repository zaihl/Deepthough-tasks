## Project Overview

### Project Name
HTML/CSS Storyboard Feature Implementation

### Project Description
This project implements a storyboard feature as part of an internship application for Deep Thought. The project consists of two main tasks:

1. **Task 1**: Creating a static webpage from a Figma design using vanilla HTML and CSS. The webpage has two states: one with the journey board closed and another with it open. Interactive elements such as dropdown menus were implemented using `<input type="checkbox">` to toggle visibility without JavaScript.
2. **Task 2**: Dynamically rendering data from a JSON file into the HTML structure created in Task 1. This involves creating reusable components for assets and rendering them based on the JSON data.

## Project Features

## Task 1: Webpage Creation

### Objective
Reproduce a Figma design into a static HTML/CSS webpage with two states: journey board closed and journey board open.

### Instructions
- **Figma Link**: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/hrBbLgcBWyoomChuEKFmpn/Untitled)
- The page was created using vanilla HTML and CSS, adhering to the design specifications.
- Interactive dropdowns were implemented using `<input type="checkbox">` to hide and show content without JavaScript.

### Preview
- You can choose to view the website online [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzaihl%2FDeepthought-tasks%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ftask1%2Findex.html)

## Task 2: Dynamic Functionality

### Objective
Render data from a JSON file into the HTML structure created in Task 1.

### Instructions
- **JSON Data Link**: [JSON File](https://dev.deepthought.education/assets/uploads/files/files/others/ddugky_project.json)
- The task involves rendering tasks and their associated assets from the JSON data.
- Each task contains multiple assets (three-level hierarchy: Project -> Tasks -> Assets).

## Installation

### Steps
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the static webpage (Task 1).
3. To view the dynamically rendered data (Task 2), ensure the JSON data is accessible and integrated correctly within the HTML file.

## Usage

### Viewing the Static Webpage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Interact with the journey board by toggling its state and using the dropdown menus.

### Viewing the Dynamic Content
1. Ensure the JSON data is linked correctly in the HTML file.
2. Open `dynamic.html` (or equivalent) to see the tasks and assets rendered dynamically.
